                  Championing a fund means you take on an existing GoFundMe for
                  a Gazan family and do your best to fundraise using online and
                  offline methods.

                  This could include posting on your social media, hosting a
                  fundraiser dinner, raffling art or other goods, or other
                  creative ideas. We have a collection of crowdsourced ideas, so

                  It is a big commitment, and can be a bit daunting, but it is
                  also extremely rewarding and meaningful - and you won&apos;t
                  be alone! You would be supported by a community of champions
                  around the world who are sharing ideas, information, and
                  support.

                  For this reason many Palestinians have set up an initial
                  fundraising page but need someone in the West to connect their
                  bank account, and then commit to transfering the money to the
                  desired recipient. Or they have been unable to set up a
                  GoFundMe at all and need support to do that
